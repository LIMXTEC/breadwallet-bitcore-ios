Bitcore wallet is a fork of Bread -- Thank you to the entire Bread team.


## The easy and secure Bitcore wallet

Bitcore Wallet is the best way to get started with Bitcore. 

### Completely decentralized

Unlike other iOS wallets, **Bitcore** is a standalone raven client. It connects directly to the raven network using [SPV](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security#Header-Only_Clients) mode, and doesn't rely on servers that can be hacked or disabled. Even if the folks behind Bitcore disappear, the app will continue to function, allowing users to access their money at any time.

### Cutting-edge security

**Bitcore** utilizes AES hardware encryption, app sandboxing, and the latest iOS security features to protect users from malware, browser security holes, and even physical theft. Private keys are stored only in the secure enclave of the user's phone, inaccessible to anyone other than the user.

### Desgined with new users in mind

Simplicity and ease-of-use is our core design principle. A simple recovery phrase (which is called a paper key) is all that is needed to restore the user's wallet if they ever lose or replace their device. **Bitcore Wallet** is [deterministic](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki), which means the user's balance and transaction history can be recovered just from the paper key.

### Features

### WARNING:

***Installation on jailbroken devices is strongly discouraged.***

Any jailbreak app can grant itself access to every other app's keychain data. This means it can access your wallet and steal your Bitcore by self-signing as described [here](http://www.saurik.com/id/8) and including `<key>application-identifier</key><string>*</string>` in its .entitlements file.
